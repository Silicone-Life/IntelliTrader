# Howdy Stranger!

This repo is forked from IntelliTrader. Repurposing the codebase towards an AI engine.
Original project hasn't been updated in almost 3 years. 
I renamed it to SiliconeTrader because I want clear distinction between this upgrade and the legacy version.

# Modules

- `SiliconeTrader` - the Main bot API.
- `SiliconeTrader.UI` - The Web Control Interface
- `SiliconeTrader.Keys` : this is the key tool now. use it to encrypt access keys to exchanges.  

# TODO: (not in order)

- Upgrade to .net 5.0
- Fix build issues
- The UI is a bit screwed. I'll just be moving to a new one. 
- Move towards API first
- A huge focus on edge. I want this one running on 100s of rPi's. 
- Ability to consume unstructured data from anywhere
- A simple AI engine

# WHY:
Because I have too much free time on my hands and I see potential in thie project. 
Money making isn't the goal. 
If you are here looking for a crypto trading bot, then this might not be the one for you.
However, if you would like to try your hand at trading electrons, welcome abord. :)
